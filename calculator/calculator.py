"""
THE APP:
Grade calculator that uses multiple functions to process student scores,
calculate averages, determine letter grades, and generate reports.

WHAT TO FIGURE OUT:
- How do you define functions with parameters?
- How do you return values from functions?
- How do you call one function from another?
- How do you convert strings to numbers?
- How do you use conditional logic in functions?

START HERE:
First, create a function to calculate the average of a list.
Then create a function to convert a number to a letter grade.
Finally, create a function to generate the complete report.

KEY CONCEPT:
Functions are defined with def function_name(parameters):
Use return to send values back from a function.
Functions make code reusable and organized.
sum() and len() are useful for calculating averages.
Conditional statements (if/elif/else) map numbers to grades.

# Function to calculate average score
# (takes a list of scores, returns the average)


    
    

# Function to convert numeric score to letter grade
# (takes a score number, returns letter A-F)


    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

# Function to determine pass/fail status
# (takes a score, returns "PASS" or "FAIL")


    
    
    

# Function to generate the complete report
# (takes name and scores, calls other functions, prints report)


    # Calculate average using the calculate_average function
    
    
    # Get letter grade using the get_letter_grade function
    
    
    # Get pass/fail status using the get_status function
    
    
    # Print the report
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

# Get user input
# (student name)


# Get test scores
# (comma-separated string, convert to list of integers)


# Print processing message


# Generate the report
# (call the generate_report function)


# Print completion message
